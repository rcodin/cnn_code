#Next 
* Make the layer implementations more general
* Create a memory manager that takes input dimentions and neural network description and automatically allocates and deallocates the layers
* Make a module which calculates the tiled input and output sizes for each layer based on last fused layer

* support stride in pooling operation
#results

3 layer fusion
fusion with im2col
make the code clean and proper

#ideas

* fc layer lazy loading for the huge weight
